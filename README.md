# Titanic Tidyverse

Analyze the Kaggle Titanic Data with the R Tidyverse

My attempt to learn Kaggle and R together.

I'm new to both Kaggle and R
R appears to be a great platform to investigate and learn about the data.

Having a computer science background, I'll probably use Python to build my models.

However, R with all its great libraries seems like the best place to start learning about the data.  The EDA part.

Feel free to correct me on anything or offer suggestions.  

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("randomForest")
install.packages("skimr")
install.packages("Prophet")"
install.packages("forecast")
install.packages("scales")"

install.packages("tidymodels")

library('mice') 
library(stringr)

```

This is an exercise to learn both the R/Tidyverse and Kaggle with the introduction Titanic competition.
